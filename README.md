# Lab: Two Pointers

This repository contains complementary material for the article "Conquiste sua vaga internacional II: Dois Ponteiros (Two Pointers)".

## 📚 Lab Structure

The lab is organized into modules, each containing a classic Two Pointers pattern problem:

1. **Pair Sum Sorted** - Pair Sum in Sorted Array
2. **Triplet Sum** - Triplet Sum
3. **Is Palindrome Valid** - Valid Palindrome
4. **Largest Container** - Largest Container

## 📁 Structure of Each Module

Each module contains:

- `PROBLEM.md` - Complete problem statement with examples
- `my-solution-template.js` - **Template where you implement your solution**
- `solution.js` - Reference solution (consult only if needed)
- `solution.test.js` - Automated tests that validate `my-solution-template.js`

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode (re-runs automatically):
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### 3. Practice the Problems

1. Read the `PROBLEM.md` file of each module
2. **Implement your solution in the `my-solution-template.js` file**
3. Run the tests: tests automatically validate your solution
4. If all pass: ✅ Congratulations! Move to the next problem
5. If they fail: study `solution.js` and try again

## 📖 Available Modules

### 1. Pair Sum Sorted
**Location:** `two-pointers/pair-sum-sorted/`

Given a sorted array and a target value, find the indices of a pair that sums to the target.

### 2. Triplet Sum
**Location:** `two-pointers/triplet-sum/`

Find all unique triplets that sum to zero.

### 3. Is Palindrome Valid
**Location:** `two-pointers/is-palindrome-valid/`

Check if a string is a palindrome (ignoring non-alphanumeric characters).

### 4. Largest Container
**Location:** `two-pointers/largest-container/`

Find the largest container that can be formed with two vertical lines.

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

- Practice the Two Pointers technique

- Improve skills in solving technical interview problems
- Validate solutions through automated tests

## 📝 Notes

- All solutions include complexity analysis
- Tests cover edge cases and examples from the article
- Explanatory comments are in English
